## 📦 Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### 🧪 Clone & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roastify-me.git
cd roastify-me
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Sentiment Analysis** using `TextBlob` detects tone from user input.
- Roasts are chosen from a curated roast bank (positive, neutral, or negative).
- Compliments are served sweet using a similar logic (defined in `compliment_engine.py`).
- Mood can be overridden with a slider for more control.
